      <description>Mark Jones began his writing career in Saturday morning cartoons, selling his first script to Filmation Studios. From there, he went on-staff at DePatie-Freleng, where he was mentored by the famed Warner Bros cartoon director, Friz Freleng, developing animated series and writing the Saturday Morning “Mister Magoo” cartoon show for CBS, and the “Pink Panther” show for NBC.
Jones was then hired by Joseph Barbera to develop and write for Hanna-Barbera Studios’ Saturday morning line-up.</description>
